# Introduction

For this assignment, I chose the [Student Performance dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/320/student+performance), which looks at student achievement in secondary education at two Portuguese schools. The dataset includes student grades, as well as demographic, social, and school-related factors. The data was collected through school reports and surveys.

The dataset is divided into two subjects:

- Mathematics (student-mat.csv)
- Portuguese Language (student-por.csv)

In this case, I will focus on the Mathematics dataset.

```{r, results='hide'}
# Download the dataset
download.file('https://archive.ics.uci.edu/static/public/320/student+performance.zip','student_performance.zip')
unzip('student_performance.zip', files = 'student.zip')
unzip('student.zip', files = 'student-mat.csv')

# Load the dataset
df <- read.csv('student-mat.csv', header = TRUE, sep = ';')

# Remove zip and csv files
file.remove(list.files(pattern = "\\.zip$|\\.csv$"))
```

# Problem 1. Summary Statistics Table
```{r, include = FALSE}
str(df)
```

The dataset contains 33 columns and 395 rows. Here's a brief overview of the columns:

Itâ€™s important to note that the final grade (G3) is strongly correlated with G1 and G2, the grades from earlier periods. Predicting G3 without using G1 and G2 is harder but more valuable.

This dataset can be used for both classification and regression tasks. Some key questions we could explore include:

- Can we predict student performance before classes begin?
- What are the key factors affecting differences in student performance?
