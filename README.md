# STK-IN4300 Statistical Learning Methods in Data Science

This repository contains my mandatory assignments for the course STK-IN4300 Statistical Learning Methods in Data Science at the University of Oslo in the Fall 2024.

## Assignment 1: Bike Sharing

In this assignment, we analyze the Bike Sharing dataset, which logs bike rentals in Washington D.C. over two years. The dataset includes environmental and seasonal factors. The analysis involves:

1. **Summary Statistics**: Overview of the dataset's variables.
2. **Data Visualization**: Identifying and correcting poor visualizations.
3. **Regression Analysis**: Building and comparing multiple linear regression models to identify significant predictors of bike rentals.

## Assignment 2: Regression and Classification

This assignment involves regression and classification tasks using the QSAR aquatic toxicity dataset and the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. The tasks include:

1. **Regression Analysis**: Comparing different regression models (linear regression, ridge regression, GAM, regression tree) to predict LC50 values.
2. **Classification Analysis**: Evaluating various classification models (k-NN, GAM, classification tree, bagged trees, random forest, neural network) to predict diabetes status.
